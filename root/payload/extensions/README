## Extensions folder
#
# This files in this folder are sourced just before payload execution.
# Users can add helper functions in here and use those functions in their payloads if desired.
# Example which allows you to call "example" from payload script:
#
# function example() {
#     printf 'I am an example!\n'
# }
#
# export -f example
